[Less](http://lesscss.org/) + [Lato](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Lato) + a different design sensibility add up to a more-readable look for the [AO3](http://archiveofourown.org/) site. 

`antenna.less` is the Stylish user stylesheet I'm using now to partially
restyle the ao3 site.

`ao3_skin_original.less` is an automatic conversion to less of the css
served now by the site.

`ao3_fonts_colors.less` is work in progress at parametrizing & cleaning up
the complete style sheet.

`components/` contains unedited automatic conversions of css -> less of the
ao3 source stylesheets.

`css/` contains css automatically compiled from the less source.
